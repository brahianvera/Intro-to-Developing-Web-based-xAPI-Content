# Intro to Developing Web-based xAPI Content
  
This project was first presented at the ADL xAPI Bootcamp in Alexandria, VA in 2015. It is now being maintained here to allow others to access this workshop. If you are interested in try the code tutorial, refer to the steps in the 

[Instructions in the webcontent Readme] (https://github.com/adlnet/Intro-to-Developing-Web-based-xAPI-Content/blob/master/webcontent/Readme.md).

#### Session description
This session will be an introduction to developing web-based Experience API (xAPI) Content with pre-built open source tools from ADL. It will first cover the syntax of an xAPI statement from a non-developer POV using [xAPI Remarks](http://adlnet.github.io/xapi-remarks/), and will gradually move to writing syntactically-correct xAPI statements with JSON and [xAPI Lab](http://adlnet.github.io/xapi-lab/). We will then validate these with the statement validator that is hosted on the Learning Record Store (LRS). The session will also cover the [xAPI Javascript wrapper](http://adlnet.github.io/xAPIWrapper/#xapiwrapper) with examples, and will touch base with the Java wrapper ([jXAPI](https://github.com/adlnet/jxapi)) that is available.
